# Pawprint CLI

## Example

You can create a Pawprint out of any `curl` command:

```shell

```

This will allow you to view on a nice webpage or share it as a short link.

## Options

- `-p, --private` Create a private Pawprint. This means the Pawprint will be created with an access token, so only people who you share the full URL (including access token) with, will be able to access the data. Also, this means the Pawprint won't be indexed by search engines.
- `-c, --copy` Copies the public share link in the clipboard so it's ready to paste in another app.

## Dependencies

This tool is based one a few other open source projects, mostly:

- [curl-trace-parser](https://github.com/apiaryio/curl-trace-parser) Parser for output from Curl --trace option
- [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) Terminal string styling done right
- [request](https://github.com/request/request) Simplified HTTP request client.
